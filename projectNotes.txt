Miso Project Notes

When creating vite project what is difference between typescript and typescript + SWC
Create react app vs vite.

Note: when installing tailwind, you can install it as a dev dependency. Tailwind will transform your code into a css file. Once these are created you donâ€™t need the actual Tailwind configs in your production build

When installing tailwind and dependencies. I had trouble getting postcss to work. I installed postcss-cli and that fixed the problem.

Remember to add outputted css file from tailwind to index.html

When mapping over arrays in react remember you need a key for each mapped item

I need to make navElement return a single li

I can make a new componenet called NavSubLists to return all the NavSubLists

I can make another componenet called NavSubListsContainer to structure all the NavSubLists
